Despite this, hate crimes against gay people have persisted, and the number of attacks recorded by police has been rising. There were 7,194 in England and Wales in the year to April 2016. Campaigners say this isn't the full picture, though, as many victims still don't report assaults.  Six people affected by hate crimes share their stories.  James and Dain were enjoying a night out together in Brighton in May 2016 when they were followed out of a nightclub and attacked on the seafront. The assault has left physical and emotional scars.  We were at the bar and we got this look from a couple of guys from across the dance floor. It takes a lot to make me feel uncomfortable but it was just such a weird look they gave us. Dain had his arm around me. I don't think they liked that. Then they started shouting at us. I told Dain we needed to get out of the club into a taxi the quickest way possible.   We left the bar. No-one was about. All of a sudden I heard running behind us. There was no way we were going to outrun them. They grabbed us from behind and chucked us to the floor. I was lying on the pavement and all I could see was James but the next thing I saw was a shoe coming towards my face. That knocked me completely unconscious.   One of the boys started kicking Dain's face really rapidly. There was a lot of aggression and shouting of ""gay boys"". Every time I tried to crawl closer to Dain, I was dragged along the pavement. At that point, a taxi drove past and called the police. I remember standing up for the first time and Dain looked at me and said, ""I can't see.""   My eye socket was completely shattered. I had haemorrhages in both my eyes and fractures on my cheeks. My tooth was chipped and my nose was broken as well. I remember being in hospital and kept asking, ""Am I going to be able to see again?"" They said, ""We can't tell you because everything is so swollen."" They couldn't even open my eyes.  James and I were very close anyway but spending that much time with each other really proved to me how strong our relationship is. I'm a very resilient person and I'm not going to live my life how someone else wants me to. I'm not going to let anyone change that. If anything, this has made me want to be who I am even more.   It's made him stronger and it's made him not care about what other people think and to go out there and be himself even more, whereas it's done the opposite to me. It's changed me. I've changed my thought process and mindset, how I think, how I look, how I speak, who I'm with, where we go and it's sad because I remember how we were before it happened and I look at us now and it's upsetting because it's them who made this happen. That's what's hard to accept.  It's a year since it happened and I thought things would probably get easier but they haven't. When we're out and about he wants us to look like we're together obviously but I'm scared of something similar happening again. It wasn't like that a year ago. We didn't go down the street holding hands but I wasn't fully aware of us making sure that we weren't seen as a couple.  I couldn't ever forgive the people who attacked us or forget what happened. It will stay with me and I'm sure it will stay with them for the rest of their lives.  I'm angry about everything that's happened - the fact that I had a black eye to explain to a six-year-old, why Mummy was hurt, why Becky had bruises. It's not something I want to explain to my child, that there's hatred in this world. It's odd that it still happens just because of who we choose to love. For once we had a babysitter and got out of the house and that happened. We haven't been out since.  The first thing he said was, ""I like lesbians"" and I thought ""Oh God, not one of these."" He had a South African accent, all seemed quite pleasant and he seemed quite tipsy but I'm never really rude to anyone. He asked our friends to kiss, to which they said ""No"" and I said, ""It's not for your pleasure.""  He said something like ""dyke"" which offended one of my mates. You don't say that. We went to the kebab shop to get a bit of food. I didn't think it was going to get violent.  Another guy that had begun joining in then started circling us as a group and focused his attention on me.   That's when he started getting touchy-feely, groping Alex's breasts and really hanging on her arm. He called us ""fat dykes"" and she pushed him away. The other guy saw her do it. He swung for her. James, Dain, Becky, Alex and Jenny tell their stories in the TV programme Is it safe to  be gay in the UK? Viewers in the UK can watch it at 21:00 on Tuesday 1 August on BBC One  .  The documentary is part of   - a season of programming across the BBC to mark the 50th anniversary of The Sexual Offences Act 1967, which partially decriminalised gay sex between men in England and Wales. I got groped, kicked and slammed into a street light. My wife got punched and our two friends got punched too. To hit a woman is wrong but do that just because we didn't want them is disgusting and vile. I am so angry I have been violated for loving my wife. The next day I had to wear glasses as I couldn't cover up the darkness around my eye. I feel guilty because I have chosen to love Becky which in turn has brought this crap into my son's life. Just me and him, we look completely normal. We wouldn't attract attention but being with Becky does because she is so obviously gay.  I'm disappointed, upset and angry with my attacker, at the court, the justice system. I just hope and pray it doesn't happen to someone else. Ian was the first born in the family and he was four years older than I was. He had this amazing smile, he just loved life really. When things were tough, he'd be there and he'd never judge you.  As we grew up, we went our separate ways. In our early 20s, I went to a gay party with a girl. It was packed. I looked across the room and I thought: ""That's Ian."" He spotted me. He came up to me, put his arm around me and he said, ""What are you doing here?"" and from that moment we realised we were both gay. That really forged this inseparable link. On the night he was attacked, he was walking down the street with his friend, Philip. He'd just had his first week at work so he was going out to have a drink.  Someone shouted, ""Faggots."" My brother turned round and said, ""I may be gay but…""  And then there was some kind of altercation. He was kicked in the groin and punched.   They were kicking him, stamping on him and shouting at him. It's shocking, absolutely shocking. I couldn't believe it. There was a crowd of people around him, which you can see on the CCTV footage. How could you leave somebody in that state? Why didn't they go back to him and check he was OK? Those questions still nag at the back of my mind. To walk away, how could you do that? Ian was in hospital for 18 days. When I got there he was unconscious with two big black eyes. His breathing was changing. My experience told me that this was the final breath. He struggled a bit and then he stopped breathing. And so he died. We were with him. It was very sad. Thousands of people with lights attended an extraordinary coming together of gay and straight people in Trafalgar Square because of what had happened. It was magic really and such a fitting event for Ian. Just across the road was where he was last conscious. I went there a couple of times to look. It really is significant. That tree, I know it very well. He's part of Trafalgar Square now. We always used to say, ""We can always live together when we get older and retire. We'll be like Darby and Joan and have a few tea parties."" We'd laugh about it. I probably miss him more and more as I get older.  You can't have hate and I think hate is a very divisive thing to hold on to. I'm starting the restorative justice programme and hoping that will give me some sense of closure and also that it will help the offenders. I'd like to meet them all. They're still alive and they have a life. I do care what happens to people and I know some people don't have the same advantages as others. I actually think he would support me doing this and this really will be a bit like a springboard in helping me move on. I'm hopeful. It started in Manchester in 2005 when I experienced three separate instances of homophobia in one day.  People were really shocked that I had these experiences all the time and I thought, ""I have to do something about this.""   I began to plant pansies wherever I'd experienced abuse. I wanted to do something that changed the location. I never wanted there to be any signage, it had to be something that was subtle but noticeable, in the way that I am in the street. A pansy is a pansy, you kind of understand and read what it's about just by knowing it's there. Quite quickly, people started telling me where they had experienced abuse and I started planting for them too. If I plant a flower for someone who's been murdered I usually dedicate it to them. I take photographs and add them to  .   I often name the pansy after the abuse that has happened. The first one I planted was called: ""I think it's about time we went gay bashing again."" Two builders sitting on a wall said that directly to my face and I was so shocked I really didn't know what to do. When you have that experience you're forced to think about what it is you can do. Do you react, do you close up?  The ritual of digging into the ground, kneeling on the ground, feels solemn and slightly healing. I'm subverting this terrible thing that's happened and turning it into something more positive. It also raises awareness. When someone's been violently attacked, the location is so loaded that they can't stop thinking about it when they go past. What I witness when I go back with them is their experience and healing of that location. They can then think: ""This isn't only the place where I was beaten up but also somewhere a pansy was planted."" It's almost like sticking a plaster over the violence. I plant pansies wherever I am. Unfortunately everywhere I go there's usually a place where someone has experienced homophobia. If I mark a location for someone I don't know, I'll contact them using social media saying, ""I've done this for you."" Every single pansy marks a story of someone who has experienced homophobia on the streets. I don't think it will end. I will always plant them."
"According to the regulator, Ofgem, it is possible to save about £300 a year if you switch your gas and electricity provider.",1 August 2017,How to switch energy supplier,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40791217,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6243/production/_97155152_gettyimages-469214836.jpg,"According to the regulator, Ofgem, it is possible to save about £300 a year if you switch your gas and electricity provider. The best savings involve taking out a ""dual fuel"" deal, where one provider supplies both forms of energy. Many people have been put off switching, but Ofgem maintains the process is very simple. Not everybody is able to switch their supplier. If you are in debt to a supplier, you might not be able to.  If you have a pre-payment meter and you owe more than £500 for gas or electricity, you might not be able to switch. There are two main types of energy deal, a fixed-term contract, typically lasting a year or 18 months, and a standard variable tariff. If you are one of the two-thirds of householders on a standard variable tariff, the potential for savings is larger. However, over the past few years the gap between standard variable tariffs and fixed rates has narrowed, as can be seen from the graph below. You will need: The change should take no longer than 17 days. That includes a 14 day cooling-off period. Your supply will not be interrupted during that time.  If you are on a fixed-rate deal and decide to switch before it ends, you may be charged an exit fee. But if you are within 49 days of the end of the deal, you should not be charged. You can contact your supplier directly, and ask if they can give you a better deal. But there will be a wider choice of deals through price comparison websites. Ofgem provides this list of approved sites: Quotezone, The Energy Shop, Runpath, Simply Switch, My Utility Genius, Switch Gas and Electric, Energylinx, Unravel It, Money Supermarket, Energy Helpline and Uswitch. These sites do not have to advertise the cheapest deals. They advertise those that you can switch to straight away, and with whom the websites have made an agreement. Better deals may be available if you are prepared to wait. However, the regulator Ofgem, is considering forcing such websites to include a clickable option to see all tariffs available, not just preferred suppliers. Citizens Advice:  Ofgem:  Which?"
Friends fans rejoiced last week when it was announced that Jennifer Aniston is returning to TV screens.,2 August 2017,Why are there so many TV shows about TV shows?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40791407,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1D46/production/_97149470_tv-comp-new-reuters-getty.jpg,"Friends fans rejoiced last week when it was announced that Jennifer Aniston is returning to TV screens. She and Reese Witherspoon are   in a new HBO series set behind the scenes of a breakfast news show. The currently-untitled project is the latest in a whole host of films and TV series to take an audience behind the camera - which raises the question of why viewers find them so fascinating. ""We all consume TV news, but it's quite hard to actually see behind it because it has to look so professional,"" says BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty. ""But the characters you find behind the scenes are so interesting.""  One criticism that has been levelled at dramas and sitcoms set behind the camera is that they are just navel-gazing - the media obsessed with itself yet again. ""There's always that risk,"" Naga says, ""But I think if you're really into politics you'll watch The Thick of It and The West Wing, and similarly if you love TV or news, you'd enjoy something like this as well.  ""Look how many medical programmes there are, or shows about lawyers or the police - we're fascinated by certain industries whether we work in them or not.""  Looking ahead to Aniston's new HBO show, Naga is confident the writers won't be short of material. ""Lots of stuff happens behind the scenes that is amusing,"" she says. ""Guests and presenters sneaking in, slurps of tea being hurriedly swallowed when it's supposed to be be our turn to talk. ""Correspondents trying to tell the story when members of the public are interfering with their job - making noise, pulling funny faces and so on."" The BBC Breakfast presenters themselves even have a tough time holding things together - regularly falling into  . ""Sometimes the audience catches our slip-ups and likes to get a bit of insight - the ability to roll with the mistakes makes the job easier,"" Naga says. ""In fact, one of the things I learned was if you make a mistake, you laugh it off, because we're all human, and it can often seem like people reading the news are one step removed from everyone else."" The questions presenters gets asked every day by members of the public is perhaps proof of how interested viewers are in the process of putting TV shows together. ""'What time do you wake up? Who's your favourite person to work with? What time do you go to bed?'. People love to know the most difficult guests and things like that,"" Naga laughs. But presenting a TV news programme is a lot harder than it looks, she adds. ""This new HBO series would need to show that it understands how much work is needed to be able to appear breezy and relaxed first thing in the morning,"" says Naga.  ""If you know your stuff you can be very relaxed. You're never allowed to moan about being tired - everyone there is so there's no point talking about it."" Naga jokes there would be a fair few storylines to be written about ""guests who turn it on for the camera but off camera are as cold as ice"". One trap that shows based in newsrooms can easily fall into is presenting a sanitised version of a job that isn't as glamorous as it looks. The Newsroom received some criticism for presenting a media workplace which ""could never exist in the real world"", as   put it. Naga herself points out that one of the many pitfalls a show like this could fall into would be for it to ""become farcical"".  ""Don't forget we are journalists and have to cover serious stories every day,"" she says. ""We are one of the first sources of news for families and must make sure we are accurate, accessible and timely. ""We have to finely balance the need to be serious and fun - not always easy as we are led by the news of the day. ""As breakfast presenters, we're part of people's lives. We are there while the audience is getting on with their day, while they have their routine, and so you have to be really aware that people feel they know you."" Asked whether she might watch Aniston's new show, she jokes: ""Yes - as long as is not on too late in the evening!"""
"We all love Thai curries, Japanese noodles and Indian snacks, so why not Asian-inspired desserts? With the amount of ice cream sold dropping globally, manufacturers are starting to experiment with exotic flavours to whet flagging appetites.",2 August 2017,Are the days of the 99 ice cream cone numbered?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40610570,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4533/production/_97151771_icecream3.jpg,"We all love Thai curries, Japanese noodles and Indian snacks, so why not Asian-inspired desserts? With the amount of ice cream sold dropping globally, manufacturers are starting to experiment with exotic flavours to whet flagging appetites. In late 1944, Major Hunter Reinburg, commanding officer of 122 Squadron of the American Marine Corps, had a hankering for ice cream.  Not surprising perhaps, since he was posted to the sweltering, jungle-covered South Pacific island of Peleliu.  So Hunter set his resourceful team of aircraft engineers to work on Operation Freeze. After some trial and error, they found that by mounting a large can filled with milk onto the underside of each wing tip of their fighter planes, attaching a stirring shaft to a wind-driven propeller, and then undertaking a training sortie at 30,000 feet, they could supply 100 servicemen with a helping of ice cream every day, whilst simultaneously provoking the Japanese to waste a few shells trying to bring them down.  Hunter was, however, missing a trick.  If, instead of flavouring his favourite treat with army-issue cocoa powder, he'd cast his eye around him to see what fruits and spices the South Pacific had to offer, then he really would have been ahead of his time. He could have tried lychee, coconut, cardamom, nutmeg or ginger - flavours that ice cream makers are now starting to experiment with. In the 70 years since Hunter went to such lengths to satisfy his passion for frozen dairy desserts, global ice cream brands have spread their reach to almost every corner of the planet. Even in Peleliu he could now probably pick up a Cornetto from his corner store. But for many years, flavours from the big international brands remained stubbornly conservative,  dominated by chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Now though, thanks to migration, long-haul travel, and the internet, consumers are becoming more adventurous and manufacturers are taking note. Parlours have sprung up across the US offering Persian-style saffron, orange blossom, and rosewater ice cream, sprinkled with nuts and drizzled with honey; and Indian-inspired flavours such as masala chai, pineapple, and kulfi.  At Chinatown Ice Cream Factory in New York, where they've been offering exotic ice creams for 40 years, they've noticed an uptick in interest from customers. Owner Christina Seid says there's often a queue of 20 customers waiting to try her Chinese-inspired range, which includes red bean, toasted sesame, and taro (a kind of sweet potato) ice cream. She thinks Americans are ready to embrace these flavours in a way they perhaps weren't when her parents, Chinese immigrants, first set up the shop. ""My father was the pioneer of a lot of these flavours. Back then people didn't even know what a mango or green tea was. ""Now, nothing is really weird."" She thinks red bean flavour, common in China, will eventually become mainstream in the US. In many of the world's biggest ice cream markets appetites have been flagging for traditional take-home tubs. Consumers are worrying about the sugar content and there's a lot of competition.  According to  , global ice-cream sales fell from 15.6bn litres in 2015 to 13bn last year. As a result, firms are watching what happens in places like The Chinatown Ice Cream Factory carefully.  ""Trends are born in the parlours where they can afford to take a gamble,"" says Alex Beckett, global food and drink analyst at Mintel. ""They become fashionable. Then they travel from Brooklyn to LA and Chicago, then to Sydney, London, Berlin, and eventually they will be picked up by manufacturers who will start to set the market for these more ethnic styles""  Yee Kwan Chan, who is based in the UK city of Sheffield and whose family is also Chinese, travels to far flung parts of the world in search of inspiration for her Yee Kwan line of desserts. ""I just want to create authentic flavours you'd find in Asia,"" she says.  Her concoctions include chocolate miso, black sesame seed, and durian - the fruit with the pungent odour often likened to sewage or something rotting - which is surprisingly popular in Asia. At Christmas she travelled to Hong Kong and is now producing egg custard tart ice cream, evoking the afternoon tea treat popular there. ""With the East Asian palate we've got sweet and we've got sour and then we have bitter: we use all our senses,"" says Ms Chan.  With foreign travel and Asian food so popular, she's convinced that Asian-inspired flavours will be on the shop shelves in the US and Europe as a matter of course in a few years' time.  But for that to happen at any scale, larger manufacturers will also need to get on board. Unilever, the world's largest producer, is open to the idea.  They already make a myriad of flavours to suit local palates, including red bean Cornettos in China, a liquorice recipe for Scandinavia, and they've just launched a ""dung dung"" ice cream - based on an ""earthy"" tasting fruit - in Indonesia.  Matt Close, Unilever's executive vice president of global ice cream, says they've always got an eye out for new flavours that might ""travel"". More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: This year in India, the world's fastest growing ice cream market, they launched a kulfi ice cream, made with condensed milk and flavoured with rose water so it tastes a little like Turkish Delight. ""I'm absolutely convinced kulfi would work in the UK,"" says Mr Close. ""You'd start where there are big Indian communities, but there is no reason that wouldn't stretch.""  While taro and red bean recipes might be harder to export, matcha (green tea) flavours seem likely to be at the forefront of any Asian invasion, he thinks. ""We've just launched a matcha ice cream in the Philippines. We'll take it to other markets.  ""I'd put money on the idea that there'd be green tea ice cream or green tea ice lollies in most markets in the not too distant future."" Booza - also known as Dondurma (in Turkey), this is made with ground powdered orchid root and mastic gum. These ice creams melt more slowly and have a thicker, chewier texture. Thai rolled ice cream - the latest Asian ice cream trend involves pouring mixture onto a freezing slab of metal then rolling it up like a piece of paper Durian ice cream - only the very adventurous are usually attracted by the the prickly Asian fruit that smells so bad it's illegal to carry it on the subway in Singapore. An acquired taste."
"It's 26 years since Yugoslavia broke into pieces and the republic of Macedonia came into being. In all that time, the new country has lacked an official, internationally agreed name, because of Greece's objections to the name ""Macedonia"". And for nearly all of that time, explains Alex Marshall, one man has been working to solve the problem.",2 August 2017,The man who has focused on one word for 23 years,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-40781213,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5F04/production/_97142342_nimetz_getty976.jpg,"It's 26 years since Yugoslavia broke into pieces and the republic of Macedonia came into being. In all that time, the new country has lacked an official, internationally agreed name, because of Greece's objections to the name ""Macedonia"". And for nearly all of that time, explains Alex Marshall, one man has been working to solve the problem. Matthew Nimetz wants to make something clear - he has not spent every waking moment of the past 23 years thinking about one word: ""Macedonia"". ""I have probably thought about it more than anyone else - including in the country,"" says the 78-year-old US diplomat. ""But I have to disappoint anyone that thinks it's my full-time job."" Since 1994, Nimetz has been trying to negotiate an end to arguably the world's strangest international dispute, in which Greece is objecting to Macedonia's name and refusing to let it join either Nato or the EU until it's changed. Greece says the name ""Macedonia"" suggests that the country has territorial ambitions over Greece's own Macedonia - a province in the north of the country - and is a blatant attempt to lay claim to Greece's national heritage. It should be called something like ""Skopje"" instead, Greece argues - Skopje being Macedonia's capital city. Macedonia, by contrast, argues that you can trace its people back to the ancient kingdom of Macedon, once ruled by Alexander the Great - and that the name ""Macedonia"" is therefore the obvious choice. One upshot is that travellers entering northern Greece from the Republic of Macedonia, and those crossing the border in the opposite direction, are both greeted by roadside signs welcoming them to Macedonia. When Nimetz began his work on the dispute he was serving as US President Bill Clinton's special envoy, but since the end of 1999 he's been the personal envoy of the UN secretary-general - his task to nudge the two sides slowly towards a resolution, for a token salary of $1 per year. Macedonia got into the UN by agreeing to be called The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) for all official purposes, but this was not intended to be a permanent solution to the problem, and created a new set of difficulties. ""It makes for very awkward sentence construction,"" Nimetz says, with some understatement.  Ban Ki-moon, the former UN secretary-general, once got muddled and called the country the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia"" by accident. ""He said to me, 'You've got to solve this problem. It's driving me crazy,'"" Nimetz says. Despite the glacial pace of negotiations, he has never seriously thought of quitting. ""Some people think it's me just sitting there thinking of adjectives to put in front of the name Macedonia - like New Macedonia, Upper Macedonia - but this issue has historical importance… importance in terms of nation-building,"" he says.  ""And it is never boring, the cast of characters dealing with it changes all the time. Think of a theatre director who does King Lear or Hamlet, but with different staging and actors. Do they get bored?"" When Nimetz first became Clinton's envoy, back in the 1990s, it looked as though the dispute could spiral out of control.  Greece had been objecting to Macedonia's name since 1991, when Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia. The following year, a million Greeks - a 10th of the population - took to the streets of Thessaloniki to protest.  Those protests helped bring down the country's prime minister, and his replacement, Andreas Papandreou, barred Macedonia's access to Greek ports. Macedonia was a "" "", he claimed. Nimetz has a surprising amount of understanding for the Greek fear that Macedonians could one day lay claim to Greek territory. ""I have to explain to people this Greek concern about irredentism is not just created out of thin air,"" he says. ""Within the last three generations, these sorts of threats were real to the country. This feeling that 'We're always being encircled.' In the Balkans, each country has a history of being dismembered, or having fought off their neighbours at some point."" He once explained the dispute to US senators by asking how they would feel if Mexico changed its name to The Republic of Mexico and Texas, then started publishing historic maps implying ownership of the whole south-west US.  However, he has equal understanding for the Macedonians. ""When the Greeks say to them, 'Oh, you only came here in the 9th, 10th Century - you're not really from this region. You should call yourselves, at the most, New Macedonia,' well, to the people of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, that's a problem. They don't consider themselves 'new'. They consider themselves indigenous as anyone."" Despite this, Nimetz did at first think there would be a quick end to the dispute. So did leading Macedonian politicians. ""I talked about it with them and they said, 'Time is in our favour. Let's just talk a few years, let things calm down, change some people in government.' But it didn't quite work that way,"" he says. A long list of names has been suggested: everything from New Macedonia and Nova Makedonija, to Slavo-Macedonia and the Republic of Skopje. At one point, both the Upper Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Upper Macedonia were on the table.  But none has yet been accepted.  It may seem as though there are no more adjectives left to try - or any point trying them - but Nimetz insists disputes get solved when the timing is right.  Just look at Northern Ireland or the reunification of Germany, he says. Change may occur because events make people look at an issue in a new light, or new leaders may come in with the political authority take tough decisions. Or people may just get exhausted by never-ending debate. He is optimistic that the timing may be right for this dispute soon. This is partly due to new leadership in Macedonia - the Social Democrat Zoran Zaev became prime minister this year, breaking a long political deadlock in the country. But also because Macedonia needs to find a solution so it can get closer to its goals of joining Nato and the EU. ""Doing that would give them reassurance, legitimacy, economic opportunities… and a sense of permanence,"" Nimetz says. It also might ease tensions in the country between ethnic Macedonians and Albanians, who make up a quarter of the population. In 2001, such tensions brought the country to the brink of civil war. But Nimetz admits convincing voters in both countries will be difficult. Macedonian leaders have promised any agreement will go to a referendum. He thinks part of the way out is to encourage people not to see this as a question of national identity. ""One ordinary citizen in Skopje once said to me: 'When I get up in the morning and I'm shaving, I look in the mirror and say,  . Well, tomorrow, when I'm shaving, do you expect me to say,   or  ?'  ""I told him his concern is understandable, but it's the wrong way to look at this. We are only talking about the formulation of the name of this state for diplomatic purposes. It won't impact the average person. ""We're not negotiating identity. If we were, I'd be out of here."" He does recognise that identity is important, though - despite being ""a great believer in globalism"". ""I believe there's a tribal aspect to us as a species,"" he says, ""and it's very hard to feel comfortable in a global world, even for people like me."" In all his time working on the dispute, there has been only one moment when Nimetz united both sides. It was at an unlikely time too, when Macedonia was putting up numerous statues of Alexander the Great in its cities, and had named its main airport after him, causing outrage in Greece. ""When that was happening, I said to a reporter from Skopje, 'I can't understand all this, because Alexander the Great was a great military leader, but he destroyed so much and killed so many people.' Well, I got hell for that - from all sides. I almost resigned.""  Nimetz has just finished his latest round of meetings on the issue, meeting politicians in Skopje, and Greece's foreign minister. A solution can be achieved, he insists, but for the immediate future he is busy simply planning a holiday ""up above the Arctic Circle to a lodge where the caribou migrate"". A good chance to get away from questions about national identity and self-determination, surely? ""Well, actually,"" he says, ""Maybe not, when you think about the First Nations of Canada…""  He then starts enthusiastically explaining Canada's debate about indigenous self-government, and it quickly becomes clear that his love of such questions is the real reason he has been able to work on a dispute about just one word for the past 23 years."
"When there are debates about the world's top performing education systems, the names that usually get mentioned are the Asian powerhouses such as Singapore and South Korea or the Nordic know-alls, such as Finland or Norway.",2 August 2017,How Canada became an education superpower,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40708421,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3667/production/_97072931_canada150.jpg,"When there are debates about the world's top performing education systems, the names that usually get mentioned are the Asian powerhouses such as Singapore and South Korea or the Nordic know-alls, such as Finland or Norway. But with much less recognition, Canada has climbed into the top tier of international rankings. In the most recent round of international Pisa tests, Canada was one of a handful of countries to appear in the top 10 for maths, science and reading. The tests, run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), are a major study of educational performance and show Canada's teenagers as among the best educated in the world. They are far ahead of geographical neighbours such as the US and European countries with strong cultural ties like the UK and France. At university level, Canada has the world's highest proportion of working-age adults who have been through higher education - 55% compared with an average in OECD countries of 35%. Canada's success in school tests is also very unusual compared with other international trends. The top performers are often cohesive, compact societies and the current highest achiever, Singapore, has been seen as a model of systematic progress, with each part of the education system integrated into an overarching national strategy. Canada does not even really have a national education system, it is based on autonomous provinces and it is hard to think of a bigger contrast between a city state such as Singapore and a sprawling land mass such as Canada. The OECD, trying to understand Canada's success in education, described the role of the federal government as ""limited and sometimes non-existent"". Also not widely recognised is that Canada has a high level of migrants in its school population. More than a third of young adults in Canada are from families where both parents are from another country. But the children of newly-arrived, migrant families seem to integrate rapidly enough to perform at the same high level as their classmates. When the most recent Pisa rankings are looked at more closely, at regional rather than national level, the results for Canada are even more remarkable. If Canadian provinces entered Pisa tests as separate countries, three of them, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec, would be in the top five places for science in the world, alongside Singapore and Japan and above the likes of Finland and Hong Kong. So how has Canada overtaken so many other countries in education? Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, says Canada's ""big uniting theme is equity"". Despite the different policies in individual provinces, there is a common commitment to an equal chance in school. He says there is a strong sense of fairness and equal access - and this is seen in the high academic performance of migrant children. Ideas for the  ? Get in touch. Within three years of arriving, the Pisa tests show the children of new migrants have scores as high as the rest of their schoolmates. It makes Canada one of the few countries where migrant children achieve at a level similar to their non-migrant counterparts. Another distinguishing feature is that Canada's teachers are well paid by international standards - and entry into teaching is highly selective. Prof John Jerrim, of the UCL Institute of Education in London, says that Canada's high league table ranking reflects the narrow socio-economic gap in school results. Rather than a country of extremes, Canada's results show a very high average, with relatively little difference between advantaged and disadvantaged students. In the most recent Pisa results for science, the variation in scores in Canada caused by socio-economic differences was 9%, compared with 20% in France and 17% in Singapore. The equitable outcome goes a long way to explaining why Canada is doing so well in international tests. It does not have a tail of underachievement, often related to poverty. It is a remarkably consistent system. As well as little variation between rich and poor students, there is very little variation in results between schools, compared with the average for developed countries. Rather than high levels of immigration being seen as a potential drag on results, Prof Jerrim says in Canada's case, this is likely to be part of its success story. Migrants coming to Canada, many from countries such as China, India and Pakistan, are often relatively well-educated and ambitious to see their children get into professional careers. Prof Jerrim says these families have an immigrant ""hunger"" to succeed, and their high expectations are likely to boost school results for their children. This has been a bumper year for education in Canada. The universities are reaping the benefits of the Trump effect, with record levels of applications from overseas students seeing  . There has also been a Canadian winner of the Global Teacher Prize, with  . As Canada marks its 150th anniversary, it can claim the status of an education superpower."

Here is a selection of the shortlisted images. The Milky Way rises above a small radio telescope at Miyun Station, National Astronomical Observatory of China, Beijing, in Haitong Yu's photograph. The image depicts light pollution, which together with electromagnetic noise, has turned many optical and radio observatories near cities both blind and deaf.  To make this image, Haitong Yu used a light-pollution filter and stacked multiple frames to show the Milky Way above the city light.  This picture of the aurora borealis swirling above snow covered trees in Murmansk, Russia, was made by Yulia Zhulikova. The trees glow a vivid pink, highlighted by street lamps. Ainsley Bennett captures the waxing crescent Moon setting in the evening sky over the Needles Lighthouse on the western tip of the Isle of Wight.  Despite the Moon being a thin crescent, the rest of its shape is defined by sunlight reflecting back from the Earth's surface. A large, searing hedgerow prominence extends from the surface of the Sun in Paul Andrew's picture. A number of different prominence types have been observed emanating from the Sun, and the hedgerow prominence is so called because of the grouping of small prominences resembling rough and wild shrubbery.   A snow-clad mountain in the Eastern Sierras, California, towers over an aspen grove in Brandon Yoshizawa's image. Above this autumn scene, the Milky Way shines. Taken from Victoria Peak, the highest mountain on Hong Kong Island,  Prisca Law's image shows a busy city in contrast to the peaceful starry sky.  The yellow haze above the landscape is light pollution. Along the coastline roads, the pattern of light signifies the fast-paced life of cities. After a long hike from his small cabin to Kvalvika, Lofoten Islands, in Norway, Nicolas Alexander Otto arrived at the slopes above the beach at about midnight.  During the hike, the aurora borealis display was relatively weak. But when he made it to the beach, the sky ignited in a colourful show of greens and purples framed by the mossy landscape.  The image was composed from six different exposures due to the high ISO camera setting and thermal noise in the foreground. The sky was added from one of these exposures.  A shooting star flashes across the sky over the craggy landscape of Portland, Dorset, as the planet Jupiter glows in Rob Bowes's photograph.  The image was made from two exposures: one for the sky and one for the rocks.  The International Space Station moves across the face of the Earth's natural satellite, the Moon, photographed in broad daylight by Dani Caxete. The ISS was illuminated by the Sun at a height of nine degrees on the horizon.  Like the Moon, the ISS receives solar rays during its several orbits of the Earth a day, making it possible to see it when the Sun is still up.  This image was made with a single shot, with no composite or clipping in the process. Noctilucent clouds stretch across the Swedish sky, illuminating Ruslan Merzlyakov's ride home in this dramatic display.  Noctilucent clouds are the highest clouds in the Earth's atmosphere and form above 61km (200,000ft).  Thought to be formed of ice crystals, the clouds occasionally become visible at twilight when the Sun is below the horizon and illuminates them. On 31 October 2016, Near Earth Asteroid 164121 (2003 YT1) made a close encounter with Earth at three million miles.  This Apollo asteroid with an orbital period of 427 days was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 18 December 2003.  Derek Robson's attempt at imaging the asteroid was done with a camera on a fixed tripod, controlled by Astrophotography Tool software.  Lying in the constellation of Gemini, IC443 is a galactic supernova remnant, a star that could have exploded as many as 30,000 years ago, Its globular appearance has earned the celestial structure the moniker of the Jellyfish Nebula.  In this picture made by Chris Heapy, at the upper left of the Jellyfish Nebula there is a much fainter background area of nebulosity, which is a large cloud of mostly molecular hydrogen gas and dust. Professional observatory data shows that what we are actually seeing are two lobes superimposed on each other, but from this angle one appears as the head of the jellyfish (to the left) and the other lobe (to the right) as the dangling tentacles.

Wayne Brookes joined 45 other paedophiles online to watch the abuse being streamed live from America. Bristol Crown Court heard he also used the site to watch a recording of a six-month-old baby being abused. Brookes, 43, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, admitted four charges of making indecent images of children and was jailed for 20 months. The court heard the former teacher accessed the online chat room after being given a 10-digit code by another paedophile. The rapist who broadcast the attack was arrested in the US in February and jailed for up to 30 years. Brookes, who had worked as a teacher for 10 years, was identified by officers after using a profile named Bear to access the chat room. He was found to have downloaded more than 200 indecent images of children, including dozens in the highest category. Judge Martin Picton said he had kept his interest in young children a secret from his partner, viewing the indecent material ""late at night"". ""One of the pieces of footage depicted the live streaming of a rape of a little boy,"" he added. ""I do give you the benefit of doubt with the issue of whether you understood that you were watching a live event."" The judge said although there was ""no suggestion"" that Brookes accessed indecent images at work or ""offended against any of the children"" in his care, his offences would have caused ""alarm and distress"" at the school where he worked.

Plans to rip up road humps to combat air pollution have been ridiculed by safety campaigners.,2 August 2017,Axing speed bumps to cut pollution 'is daft',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40788674,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15EA5/production/_97156798_mediaitem97156797.jpg,"Plans to rip up road humps to combat air pollution have been ridiculed by safety campaigners. They are writing to ministers to warn that removing speed bumps will actually increase danger to children. The government said it would fund councils in England to tear out humps because they elevated pollution as drivers surged between them. Campaigners say the risk of accidents from speeding drivers almost certainly outweighs the long-term pollution risk. A government spokeswoman promised that road safety wouldn't be compromised by any changes. Safety organisations think the government's policy is motivated by the desire to appear pro-motorist at a time when drivers are aggrieved by possible restrictions on diesel cars. Living Streets, which campaigns for children to walk safely to school, says if councils remove road humps without installing other measures such as chicanes or speed cameras, it will deter children from walking and cycling. Instead, the group say, they will be taken to school in cars, which in turn will increase pollution while reducing exercise for children. Its spokeswoman Rachel Maycock, who has a three-year-old daughter, told BBC News: ""This idea is completely daft and irresponsible.  ""Of course we all worry about the air our children breathe - but we also worry about reckless drivers going far too fast."" The group has written to protest to Environment Secretary Michael Gove, along with the Campaign for Better Transport and the cycle organisation CTC. The campaigners say the government has misinterpreted guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. The guidance says that ""where physical speed reduction measures are used to reduce road danger and injuries, consider using them to encourage drivers to maintain a reduced, steady pace along the whole stretch of road, rather than road humps that may increase acceleration and braking-related emissions"".  A spokeswoman for NICE told BBC News: ""We don't say anything about ripping up road humps and getting rid of them - we just want to promote smoother driving.  ""Whenever we make a recommendation about considering any measures other than speed humps, the media reports it as us recommending getting rid of speed humps - which we are not.""  She said if councils were considering measures to slow traffic, average speed cameras might be more effective in some cases than humps.  Seven safety groups contacted by BBC News all said the humps policy was a distraction from the real issue in the environment department's nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduction strategy. They complained that the government had ignored advice from its own technical experts that the fastest way to lower pollution was by charging drivers of dirty vehicles to enter cities. Roger Geffen, from CTC, said: ""While drawing up plans to tackle lethal air pollution, ministers received evidence that road user charging would be the most effective way.  ""However, they said they'd rather councils removed speed humps instead.  ""Far from reducing the annual death toll due to pollution, that would merely increase the numbers of people killed by speeding instead.  ""Do we really need yet another court case before ministers heed the advice of their experts?"" Dr Adrian Davis, visiting professor of health and transport at the University of the West of England, told BBC News: ""The fact is, numerous studies had shown that unless drivers are forced to slow down by physical obstacles like road humps they will continue to drive too fast in residential areas. ""Scrapping humps without replacing them with some other form of physical measures would be both ridiculous and dangerous."" But Hugh Bladon, from the Alliance of British Drivers, welcomed the decision to fund the removal of humps, saying that they would inevitably increase pollution and reduce fuel efficiency because many drivers would accelerate away from them. ""It needs better education for drivers to drive smoothly and safely, rather than road humps,"" he told BBC News. ""I admit I don't know how you would achieve that."" A government spokeswoman promised that road safety wouldn't be compromised by any changes.  She said: ""Reducing roadside pollution is a priority for this government - which is why we have committed £3bn to help towns and cities take action against harmful emissions caused by dirty diesels."""

"More than a million women in their early 60s have become poorer as a result of delays to their state pensions, according to a new study.",2 August 2017,"Older women poorer after pension age change, says IFS",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40791216,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1538D/production/_97152968_mediaitem97152967.jpg,"More than a million women in their early 60s have become poorer as a result of delays to their state pensions, according to a new study. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that, on average, women aged between 60 and 62 were now £32 a week worse off. As a result poverty rates among that group have risen sharply, it said. But the IFS also said the savings, and extra tax from working women, meant the state was £5.1bn a year better off. Public sector debt   and the government borrowed £46.2bn in the past financial year. The government said its pensions policy was ""fair and sustainable"" and matched continuing rises in life expectancy.  However, the campaign group WASPI (Women Against State Pension Age Inequality) said the research was shocking. ""Once again, this shows that the government has implemented state pension age (SPA) reforms without adequately considering the full impact of these changes on the women affected,"" said WASPI director, Jane Cowley.  ""Whether it is the 3.5 million WASPI women who were not given sufficient warning of rises to their state pension age, or the sharp rise in income poverty among 60 to 62-year-old women, the government needs to sit up and start realising that its changes have devastating consequences on the women affected."" The IFS study showed that many women in the age group already affected by the pension change have continued working.  But the effect of waiting longer for their state pension has, on average, outweighed the gains made by those who have continued to earn a salary. Thus the female 60-62 age group as a whole was earning an extra £2.5bn a year, an average of £44 per week. But the same group has also lost £4.2bn in pension and other benefits per year, or £74 per week. Jonathan Cribb, of the IFS, said the new policy was clearly putting pressure on the budgets of some households. ""The increased state pension age is boosting employment - and therefore earnings - of affected women but this is only partially offsetting reduced incomes from state pensions and other benefits,"" he said.  ""Since both rich and poor women are losing out by, on average, roughly similar amounts the reform increases income poverty rates among households containing a woman who has reached age 60 but has not yet reached her state pension age.""  Looking at the worst affected individuals, the IFS calculated that absolute poverty rates - measured after housing costs - had increased from 15% of women aged between 60 and 62 to 21% of them.   It said there was no evidence that any of the women were in fact experiencing ""material deprivation"" -that is, people saying they cannot afford a range of important items.  Such families may have ""smoothed"" their spending over time, the researchers suggested. Caroline Abrahams, at the charity Age UK, said the IFS figures were ""extremely worrying"". ""While it may have encouraged a number to work longer, many women in their sixties were simply not aware of the rise in SPA and, as was predicted by experts, they have either had too little time to make adequate preparations or have been unable to continue working due to ill health, caring responsibilities or unemployment,"" she said.  But the changes have boosted the government finances. The IFS said that the savings to the public purse had been boosted by the extra income tax and national insurance payments from those women continuing to work, which meant the government's total saving was now running at £5.1bn per year. The study said there was also an effect on single men in their early 60s, who used to be able to claim pension credit.  Under the rules, eligibility for pension credit is also being pushed back. As a result, single men aged 60 to 62 are on average £21 a week worse off, the study suggests. The long-standing policy of equalising women's state pension age with that of men, and then raising it for both groups, has become increasingly controversial. The decision to   was first made back in 1995. Many women who are being affected say they were never made aware of the changes, which have now come as a shock to them. The process kicked off in 2010, with the plan to raise the SPA steadily from age 60 to 65 by the year 2020. But then in 2011 the government decided to accelerate the policy. The SPA will thus be equalised at 65 two years earlier in 2018, and then rise by another year to 66, by 2020. Further increases to 67 and even 68 are in the pipeline. With the process still under way, women currently qualify for their state pension at nearly 64. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""More people are in work than ever before, including a record 9.9 million older workers. ""Women retiring today can still expect to receive the state pension for over 24.5 years on average - which is more than any generation before them and several years longer than men."""

"British Gas will increase electricity prices by 12.5% from 15 September, its owner Centrica has said, in a move that will affect 3.1 million customers.",1 August 2017,British Gas to raise electricity prices,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40787555,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CDD6/production/_97149625_gettyimages-469777200.jpg,"British Gas will increase electricity prices by 12.5% from 15 September, its owner Centrica has said, in a move that will affect 3.1 million customers. Gas prices are unchanged, but the average annual dual-fuel bill for a typical household on a standard tariff will rise by £76 to £1,120, up by 7.3%. Centrica said the rise was a result of transmission and distribution costs and the costs of government policy. But the government said its policy costs ""could not explain"" the rises. Centrica said the price increase was its first since November 2013, adding that British Gas was one of the last suppliers to raise prices. The company said it would protect its most ""vulnerable customers"" against the rise and that British Gas would credit more than 200,000 people on the government's Warm Home Discount with £76. Centrica chief executive Iain Conn told the   that wholesale costs had gone down and were not the reason for the price rise. ""We have seen our wholesale costs fall by about £36 on the typical bill since the beginning of 2014 and that is not the driver. It is transmission and distribution of electricity to the home and government policy costs that are driving our price increase."" He added: ""We are selling electricity at a loss and that is not sustainable."" British Gas had frozen its gas and electricity prices for six months in February, saying at the time it was able to do so by cutting costs to offset higher wholesale prices. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""Energy firms should treat all their customers fairly and we're concerned this price rise will hit many people already on poor value tariffs. ""Government policy costs make up a relatively small proportion of household energy bills and cannot explain these price rises."" ""In response to a letter from the Business and Energy Secretary asking what action the regulator intended to take to safeguard customers on the poorest value tariffs and the future of the standard variable tariff, Ofgem has committed to taking prompt action, in consultation with consumer experts, to develop proposals including a safeguard tariff. ""We want to see rapid progress on this commitment."" Alex Neill of Which? magazine urged British Gas customers on the standard variable tariff deal to switch to another provider immediately. ""For the customers of British Gas, they won't really care about any of this squabbling about who's to blame for the costs or the price rises,"" she said.  ""At the end of the day, these people are now paying another £76 on top of what is already more than £1,000 a year for a bill. And they're not really seeing the difference in value that they are getting from British Gas for that £76."" Centrica tried to land the blame for higher bills partly on the government's doormat, but the government wasn't having it. Renewable targets, smart meter rollout, subsidies for insulation and other social and environmental policies were a big factor driving prices higher. The government abandoned a manifesto promise to cap energy bills and instead threw this perennially hot potato to the regulator Ofgem, which is currently consulting on what action to take.  Umpteen probes, competition reviews, promises or threats of caps or nationalisation - the problem of what to do about energy remains as thorny as ever.  The government has reiterated its position that it is not ruling anything out - either by regulation or legislation. That means that although it's on the back-burner for now, an energy price cap is still officially an option. Shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead told   that he believed the government should have acted on its pre-election promise of imposing a price cap on energy costs. ""It is really important now that energy prices are stabilised and we need a cap to do that,"" he said. ""We also need action on the make-up of the customer base of energy companies. It clearly is not sustainable as far as customers are concerned being on mainly these standard variable tariffs, which land the greatest cost on the customers who can least bear it on a regular basis."" Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""This is a colossal increase that will really hurt customers already struggling with rising prices due to the deteriorating economic situation. ""As a former public utility, British Gas has a huge number of customers who don't switch and is clearly treating these people like cash cows. ""We need to open up the market to more competition to drive down prices and take action to help lower income families. As things stand, there will be a lot of people in fuel poverty this winter shivering in homes they cannot afford to heat or even light."" Centrica Consumer chief executive Mark Hodges said: ""We held off increasing prices for many months longer than most suppliers in order to protect our customers from rising costs, so it is a difficult decision to have to announce an increase in electricity prices."" The company added that 5.3 million of its customers would be unaffected by the rise. The news came as Centrica's half-year results revealed that it lost 377,000 customer accounts in the first half of 2017, with its consumer earnings dropping by more than a quarter as a result. Underlying operating profits from its UK home energy supply arm fell 26% to £381m as the group said it was also hit by warmer than normal temperatures and the pre-payment tariff cap. Centrica's overall underlying operating profits were 4% lower at £816m for the six months to 30 June. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.
